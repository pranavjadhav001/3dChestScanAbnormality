# 3dChestScanAbnormality

Luna 16 dataset contains ct scan slices of 10 patients.
Each slice if abnormality is present in that image has a corresponding mask image present which shows the location of abnormality.
I have done Preprocessing of the data and visualization so that problem can be made simpler.
